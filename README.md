# BRO-Robot
The code of my robot that i used in the Brazilian Robotics Olympiad
The majority of the robots used in this olympiad were made with the Lego Educational Kit, and the robot that i used is no different.
It's a code in python language utilizing the pybricks micropython library from the lego mindstorms EV3 extension on Visual Studio Code
I'm currently working in a translation of the comments and variables from portuguese to english
The objective of the code is to pass through a great number os obstacles and when it reaches a certain place in the track it have to collect 6 spheres, 3 being black a 3 being enveloped with tinfoil
And when it finishes colecting those spheres, it has to delivery it to two specific places in the corners of a little arena that is where it collected the spheres.
Im gonna drop the rules and instructions of the olympiad on this folder.
I started from the absolute zero, i knew nothing of python and robotics at all, and in six months i studied everyday to build this code, it works with a bluetooth conection between two controllers and this was one of the hardest things in the code, because the instructions of the lego weren't very clear, and i had to use external knowledge to communicate two controllers, because one controller only has four ports for motors and four ports for sensors, an i was using six sensors and five motors.
I applied a lot of math concepts like trigonometry to solve some degrees problems, and also applied a PID controller, using a really small part of calculus.
